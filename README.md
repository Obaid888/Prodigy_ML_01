Dataset:
Utilized the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from 
Kaggle.

Data Extraction:
Extracted the dataset from a zip file.

Data Preparation:
Loaded the dataset and selected key features: GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, and FullBath.
Preprocessed the data by handling missing values.

Model Training:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
Achieved strong performance metrics on both training and testing sets.

Model Interpretation:
Printed the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature.

Test Data Predictions:
Loaded the test dataset, prepared it, and made predictions.
Saved the predictions to a CSV file.


This project demonstrates the effectiveness of linear regression in real estate price prediction. By understanding and leveraging key features, we can make informed predictions and decisions in the housing market.
